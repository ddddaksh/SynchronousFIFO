Overview
A Synchronous FIFO buffer is a critical component in digital circuits used for temporary data storage, ensuring data is written and read in the same order. This project implements a Synchronous FIFO using Icarus Verilog and provides multiple testbenches to validate the design.

Features
Implementation of Synchronous FIFO.
Multiple testbenches to validate functionality and corner cases.
Outputs can be viewed using GTKWave.

Requirements:
  Icarus Verilog
  GTKWave
